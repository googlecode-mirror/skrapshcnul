			<p>
				Lunchsparks is a platform connecting professionals with each other.
			</p>
			<p>
				We believe that it doesn't matter what you know, its who you know. Our goal is to encourage networking by ensuring that you are paired up with someone who is relevant professionally to you through our platform.
			</p>
			<p></p>
			When we design the algorithm, we want to make sure that the person that we connect you to clicks instantly with you, and that the time spent is a quality one. <p></p>
			<p>
				Increasing your business network can mean the difference between success and obscurity. Lunchsparks.me uses the time you have at lunch to have you meet other professionals, using a unique algorithm that finds relevant people you don't know yet.

				Lunchsparks is founded by Jacky Yap, Goh Bing Han and Nguyen Hoanh Tien.
