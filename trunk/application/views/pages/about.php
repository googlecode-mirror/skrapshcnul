		<div>
			<p>
				Lunchsparks is a platform connecting professionals with each other.
			</p>
			<p>
				We believe that ultimately, it is whom you know that determines how far you go. Our goal is to make networking effective and efficient by ensuring that you are paired up with someone who is relevant professionally to you through our platform, as defined by yourself.
			</p>
			<p>
				When we design the algorithm, we want to make sure that the person that we connect you to clicks instantly with you, and that the time spent is a quality one. Your connected lunch/meetup partner will be someone that has potential value to you.
			</p>
			<p>
				Increasing your business network can mean the difference between success and obscurity. Lunchsparks uses the time you have at lunch to have you meet other professionals, using a unique algorithm that finds relevant people you don't know yet.
			</p>
			<p>
				Lunchsparks is founded by Jacky Yap, Goh Bing Han and Nguyen Hoanh Tien
