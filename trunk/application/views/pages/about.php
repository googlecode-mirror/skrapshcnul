				Founded in August 2011, Lunchsparks is an exclusive networking platform that helps connect you with the correct people. Lunchsparks simplifies the whole process of networking and directs you with exactly the person you are looking for. Lunchsparks allows you to networking effectively despite your busy schedule and recommends you to the right people who are professionally relevant to you. With Lunchsparks, you decide who you want to meet.
			</p>
			<p>
				When we design the system, we want to make sure that the person that we connect you to clicks instantly with you, and that the time spent is a quality one. Your connected lunch/meetup partner will be someone that has potential value to you. Through our algorithm, we maximize the value created through the networking session over lunch, thereby increasing the chances of collaboration and partnership, making great contacts for your career.
			</p>

				Increasing your business network can mean the difference between success and obscurity. Lunchsparks uses the time you have at lunch to have you meet other professionals, including those that are beyond your network.

				Lunchsparks is founded by Jacky Yap, Goh Bing Han and Nguyen Hoanh Tien and is based in Singapore.
